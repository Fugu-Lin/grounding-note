      "**Perplexity:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus:**  Provides concise, accurate answers to your questions by directly citing sources from the web. It's excellent for research and finding trustworthy information.\n",
      "* **Strengths:** \n",
      "    * **Transparency and reliability:** You can see exactly where the information comes from, fostering trust in the results.\n",
      "    * **Concise summaries:**  It summarizes key points, saving you time and effort compared to sifting through long articles.\n",
      "    * **Conversational search:** Allows you to ask follow-up questions to refine your search and delve deeper into a topic.\n",
      "* **Weaknesses:**  \n",
      "    * **Limited creativity:**  Primarily focuses on factual information; might not be ideal for brainstorming or creative explorations. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Komo (formerly Felo):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus:** Aims to provide a more interactive and personalized search experience by combining AI chat with relevant search results.  \n",
      "* **Strengths:**\n",
      "    * **User-friendly interface:** Designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.\n",
      "    * **Creative prompts and exploration:** Encourages brainstorming, offers suggestions, and helps you explore related concepts. \n",
      "    * **Combines search and chat:** You can get both information and engage in a conversation about the results.\n",
      "* **Weaknesses:** \n",
      "    * **Transparency of sources:**  Sources are often not as directly cited or as easily verifiable as in Perplexity. \n",
      "    * **Reliance on AI chat:**  May prioritize the chatbot interaction over providing the most accurate or comprehensive search results. \n",
      "\n",
      "**In a nutshell:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **For research and finding reliable information, choose Perplexity.**  Its focus on accuracy and transparency is hard to beat.\n",
      "* **For a more interactive and creative search experience, try Komo.**  Its chatbot integration and user-friendly approach can be helpful for exploration and idea generation.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Here's a basic roadmap to get you started:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Set up your environment:**\n",
      "   - **Download Python:** Get the latest version of Python from the official website ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)) and install it on your computer.\n",
      "   - **Choose an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** This is a program where you'll write your code. Popular choices include:\n",
      "     - IDLE (comes bundled with Python)\n",
      "     - VS Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/))\n",
      "     - PyCharm ([https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/))\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Start with the fundamentals:**\n",
      "   - **Print statements:** The `print()` function displays output on your screen.\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Variables:**  Containers for storing data.\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     name = \"Alice\" \n",
      "     age = 30\n",
      "     print(\"My name is\", name, \"and I am\", age, \"years old.\")\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Data types:** Python has different types of data like strings (text), integers (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers), booleans (True or False).\n",
      "   - **Operators:** Perform operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), etc.\n",
      "   - **Input:** Get input from the user using `input()`.\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
      "     print(\"Hello,\", name + \"!\")\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Control Flow:**\n",
      "   - **Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** Make decisions in your code.\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     temperature = 25\n",
      "     if temperature > 30:\n",
      "         print(\"It's a hot day!\")\n",
      "     elif temperature > 20:\n",
      "         print(\"It's a pleasant day.\")\n",
      "     else:\n",
      "         print(\"It's a bit chilly.\")\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Loops (`for`, `while`):** Repeat blocks of code.\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     for i in range(5): # Print numbers 0 to 4\n",
      "         print(i)\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data structures:**\n",
      "   - **Lists:** Ordered collections of items.\n",
      "     ```python\n",
